PYTHON TECHNICAL TEST
 
Question A
Your goal for this question is to write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether they overlap. As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8).
 
Question B
The goal of this question is to write a software library that accepts 2 version string as input and returns whether one is greater than, equal, or less than the other. As an example: “1.2” is greater than “1.1”. Please provide all test cases you could think of.
 
 
Question C
At Ormuco, we want to optimize every bits of software we write. Your goal is to write a new library that can be integrated to the Ormuco stack. Dealing with network issues everyday, latency is our biggest problem. Thus, your challenge is to write a new Geo Distributed LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with time expiration. This library will be used extensively by many of our services so it needs to meet the following criteria:
 
    1 - Simplicity. Integration needs to be dead simple.
    2 - Resilient to network failures or crashes.
    3 - Near real time replication of data across Geolocation. Writes need to be in real time.
    4 - Data consistency across regions
    5 - Locality of reference, data should almost always be available from the closest region
    6 - Flexible Schema
